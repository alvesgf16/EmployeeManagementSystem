# EmployeeManagementSystem
This project was completed for CPRG-211. It is an Employee Management System that allows Managers to login and add, delete, and modify employees, as well as set employees as inactive. It also allows the managers to view payroll information, schedule employees, approve requested time-off, and manage employee performance ratings.

Employees may use the system to view and modify their information and request time off.
